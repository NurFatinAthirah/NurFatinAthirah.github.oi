A school is an educational institution that provide learning spaces and learning environments for students.
<br>
A school is also a place where children go to learn from a teacher. Most of a student's time is spent in a
<br>
classroom. Besides, the names for these schools vary by country. When I was kid, I thought that school was
<br>
waking up early and have a lot of study and I a place where I have a lot of work. When I am 6 years old, I 
<br>
started study at Tadika Kemas. I still remember the moment that my mom and dad were so happy and proud for 
<br>
me when my first day go to school.After that, I go to Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Tunjong for my primary school.
<br>
In this school I started to have a lot of friends. My experience in this school has been filled with funny 
<br>
and happy moments. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
After finished my UPSR, I continued my study in high school. After finished my primary school, I go to 
<br>
Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tengku  Suleiman to continue my studies. In this school, I had a great teacher
<br>
that gave me a lot of experience and gave me help when I needed. I am also a hostel student at this school.
<br> 
In hostel I learned many of thing such as how to manage time wisely and be independent. There are some of 
<br>
advantage for hostel students with are learn to be self-reliant, better environment for studying, increased 
<br>
cultural awareness and others. Besides, I have my favorite subject with is mathematic and also got A in my
<br> 
SPM and PT3 result.After graduated, I continued my studies at Universiti Teknologi Mara. I learned a lot of 
<br>
experience on my study journey such as about my mental health, management skills problem-solving and other.
<br>
In form 3 I have been appointed as a school perfect.
